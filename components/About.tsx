					I'm Soony. ðŸ’¯ You might also know me as PAPA React! I'll be your coach
					& mentor inside the PAPAFAM, here's a little bit about me... I've been
					coding for over 10 years now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked
					both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their
					companies. Along the journey I realized my passion existed in helping
					others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming developers. ðŸŒŸ With
					this passion, I have now trained thousand's of developers across the
					globe. Through live coaching sessions on YouTube, I have accumulated
					several MILLION views demonstrating how to apply developer skills in a
					range of cool builds and challenges. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching
					REAL WORLD projects to help students enter the world of web
					development. You'll get hands-on experience and learn the skills that
					are required to succeed in the real-word in this community. And if
					that's not enough I have cloned most of the applications you have used
					in your life!
